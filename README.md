# Note-Taker-ExpressJS

Creating a Note Taker that can be used to write and save notes.

# Why did I build this project?

To create an application using Express.js and persistent storage that will allow users to take notes via a web interface. This is done by creating POST and GET routes to add and retrieve notes from persistent storage. The application features a sleek interface and demonstrate my current skills and knowledge of Express.js and routing. The Note Taker application will then be deployed to Heroku using the Heroku CLI.

# So far I have achieved?

1. To develop my research skills and troubleshooting. I was able to Understand errors with panicking and be able to research errors, and find a solution.

2. Creating and deploying apps using heroku.

3. Have the application functioning.

# What I intend to add in the near future?

1. To continue to build on it with the skills I continue to gain. Be able to acces the notes once clicked on it and delete the notes.
